             <p>In December 2019, at the ripe age of 45, 
               I was diagnosed with breast cancer. In January of 2020 
               I had a lumpectomy and in February I underwent an intensive 
               invasive radiation treatment called brachytherapy.  
               When I finally felt well enough to head back out into the world, 
               Covid had shut the world down. This experience gave me a new lens 
               on which to view my life and I vowed to appreciate all the little 
               things and participate more fully in the big things. 
               Life's too short but mine is pretty fabulous. The following are just 
               a few of the ways I am making the most of my time on this planet. </p>
